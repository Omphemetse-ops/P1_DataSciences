# P1_DataSciences: Sales Prediction
This data science project focuses on leveraging predictive modeling techniques to forecast sales trends and optimize business strategies. By analyzing historical sales data and external factors influencing sales performance, this project aims to provide actionable insights for enhancing revenue generation and improving decision-making processes.

## Problem Statement:
Determining the most effective advertising platform for driving sales involving analyzing various factors such as the reach and engagement levels of each platform, the target audience, and the overall cost-effectiveness of advertising on TV versus radio. By evaluating these factors, businesses can make informed decisions on where to allocate their advertising budget to maximize sales and enhance their Return on investment (ROI).

## Objective
Use machine learning techniques to analyze historical data on ad spend and sales performance to predict future sales and identify which platform is more influential in driving sales, aiding in strategic decision-making and optimizing advertising budget allocation.

## Stages Progress:
### Part 1:
- Problem statement and Objective defined.
- Data has been uploaded in csv format called Advertising.csv
- Jupiter Python: will be used to do the Part 2, 3 and 4.

### Part 2:
- Data is clean: No missing values or Errors identified.

### Part 3:
- Model to be used for Training, testing and making prediction is Multiple Linear Regression.
- Multiple Linear Regression: Because there are multiple predictors which are (TV, Radio and Newspaper) that could potentially influence the dependent variable and leads us to a more comprehensive understanding of the relationship between the predictors and the outcome variable.
